Titanic Survival Prediction: Supervised Learning Project 
A supervised learning approach to predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The project addresses a classification problem using various algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Logistic Regression, SVC, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Voting Classifier.

The dataset, obtained from the famous Titanic Kaggle competition, was preprocessed and explored to handle missing values, engineer informative features, and address the class imbalance. The models were trained on a split dataset with stratified sampling to ensure representative class distributions.

The hyperparameter tuning process was applied to optimize the models, aiming for improved performance. The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the top performer, achieving an validation AUC score of 0.91, with accuracy 0.85, precision 0.87, and recall 0.74 metrics.

The project's GitHub repository contains the code, along with detailed explanations of the data preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
